### Workflow authoring

Be more confident when authoring and modifying workflows. Find errors before committing workflows with:

**Syntax highlighting** for workflows and GitHub Actions Expressions makes it clear where values are inserted at execution time:

**Integrated documentation** for the workflow schema, expression functions, and even event payloads:

**Validation and code completion** for the YAML schema and GitHub Actions Expressions. Get instant validation and code completion for the workflow schema, expression functions, event payloads, and job or step `outputs`:

**Smart validation and code completion for actions and reusable workflows**: the extension automatically parses parameters, inputs, and outputs for referenced actions and called reusable workflows for code-completion and validation.

Unfortunately, at this time we are not able to support the extension with [remote repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories) (including [github.dev](https://github.dev/) and [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/)), so please use the extension with locally downloaded GitHub repositories for the best experience. Please check back here for updates in the future!

We have enabled experimental functionality to support GitHub Enterprise Server, but this feature is an experimental beta and currently unsupported. To try this out, enable the `use-enterprise` setting to authenticate with your `GitHub Enterprise Server Authentication Provider` settings
