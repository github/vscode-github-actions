### Workflow authoring

Be more confident when authoring and modifying workflows. Find errors before committing workflows with:

**Syntax highlighting** for workflows and GitHub Actions Expressions makes it clear where values are inserted at execution time:

**Integrated documentation** for the workflow schema, expression functions, and even event payloads:

**Validation and code completion** for the YAML schema and GitHub Actions Expressions. Get instant validation and code completion for the workflow schema, expression functions, event payloads, and job or step `outputs`:

**Smart validation and code completion for actions and reusable workflows**: the extension automatically parses parameters, inputs, and outputs for referenced actions and called reusable workflows for code-completion and validation.
